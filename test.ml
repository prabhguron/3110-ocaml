(* Exercise: values [★]
What is the type and value of each of the following OCaml expressions?
7 * (1 + 2 + 3)
"CS " ^ string_of_int 3110 *)

(* answers

int and 42
string and CS 3110

code to check 
7 * (1+2+3)
;;
- : int = 42

"CS " ^ string_of_int 3110;;
- : string = "CS 3110" *)

(* Exercise: operators [★★]

Examine the table of all operators in the OCaml manual (you will have to scroll down to find it on that page).
Write an expression that multiplies 42 by 10.
Write an expression that divides 3.14 by 2.0. Hint: integer and floating-point operators are written differently in OCaml.
Write an expression that computes 4.2 raised to the seventh power. *)

(* answers and code
42 * 10;; output -> int = 420;

3.14 /. 2.0;; output -> float = 1.57;;

4.2 *. 4.2 *. 4.2 *. 4.2 *. 4.2 *. 4.2 *. 4.2;; output -> float = 23053.9333248000075; *)


(* Exercise: equality [★]

Write an expression that compares 42 to 42 using structural equality.
Write an expression that compares "hi" to "hi" using structural equality. What is the result?
Write an expression that compares "hi" to "hi" using physical equality. What is the result? *)

(* Answers an code 


42 = 42;; bool = true
"hi" = "hi";; output bool = true
"hi" == "hi" output bool = false *)


let () = assert (1 + 1 = 2);;
